## Ling Simple API (0.0.1 - alpha)

This is the beginning of the interesting project. For example - you develop front-end application, but 
u need the way to store data in Database. Usually, its too lazy to develop back-end server.

This tool will provide the simplest back-end server with build-in authorization and users system.
Right now it's the application, but I planned to make library from it. With simple interfaces to add new controllers.
I use `FastAPI`. It seems pretty for me, but it not enough for me, I need a little bit more.
